nodejs-requestbin
=================

API wrapper for [RequestBin](http://requestb.in/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fvdm/nodejs-requestbin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fvdm/nodejs-requestbin)


Installation
------------

With NPM for the latest *stable* release:

    npm install requestbin

Or from Github for the *most recent* code, but may be unstable:

    git clone https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-requestbin
    npm install ./nodejs-requestbin


Usage
-----

This module has only four methods and each of them requires a callback function as last parameter to receive the results. The API response is JSON parsed to an object or array.

```js
var requestbin = require('requestbin')
requestbin.create( callbackFunction )
```


Callback & errors
-----------------

The callback receives only one parameter `err` in case of an error. This will be an `instanceof Error` with stack trace and sometimes more properties to describe the error.

When everything seems fine the `err` param is `null` and a second param `data` contains the result.

```js
function callback( err, data ) {
    if( !err ) {
        console.log( data )
    } else {
        console.log( err )          // message + info properties, ie. details
        console.log( err.stack )    // what caused it
    }
}
```

#### Errors

    Error: disconnected         : connection closed too early
    Error: request failed       : request can't be made
    Error: invalid response     : API did not return JSON
    Error: HTTP error           : a HTTP error like 404
    

.create ( [isPrivate], callback )
---------------------------------

Create a new bin.

* `isPrivate` - *optional* - *boolean* - Set to `true` to make this request bin private.

```js
requestbin.create( console.log )
```

```js
{ color: [ 70, 150, 120 ],
  name: 'oiwxgloi',
  private: false,
  request_count: 0 }
```

The test URL is `http://requestb.in/NAME`
The inspect URL is `http://requestb.in/NAME?inspect`


.get ( binID, callback )
--------------------------

Get a bin by its name/id.

```js
requestbin.get( 'oiwxgloi', console.log )
```

```js
{ color: [ 70, 150, 120 ],
  name: 'oiwxgloi',
  private: false,
  request_count: 1 }
```


.requests ( binID, callback )
-----------------------------

```js
requestbin.requests( 'oiwxgloi', console.log )
```

```js
[ { content_length: null,
    body: '',
    form_data: [],
    remote_addr: '1.2.3.4',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: 
     { Host: 'requestb.in',
       Connection: 'keep-alive',
       Accept: '*/*',
       'User-Agent': 'curl/7.27.0' },
    content_type: null,
    time: 1358144300.182959,
    query_string: '',
    path: '/oiwxgloi',
    id: 'sz42lo' } ]
```


.request ( binID, requestID, callback )
---------------------------------------

```js
requestbin.request( 'oiwxgloi', 'sz42lo', console.log )
```

The output is much like the previous example, but it's an object instead of array.
